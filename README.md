- I used VS code in creating the website. I followed online tutorials since it's been a while since I coded using HTML. I mainly used lists and pictures. I downloaded a palette and made a logo in canva by editing pictures.
- My takeaway here is, I had fun making the site. It was frustrating especially when I try to position the different elements. Upon relearning HTML and CSS, I realized that a lot of things changed. There were things in the tutorial that I was totally unfamiliar with despite browsing basic tutorials only. I guess the language continues to evolve.
